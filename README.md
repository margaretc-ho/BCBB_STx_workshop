### HPC instructions for Students

### Running RStudio Server on Biowulf HPC
Please see the official instructions at https://hpc.nih.gov/apps/rstudio-server.html for setting up your interactive session, creating a tunnel, and accessing R Studio Server using local host, assigned port and web browser
I also created an instructions PDF [RStudioServer_on_Biowulf_instructions_082324MH.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17080127/RStudioServer_on_Biowulf_instructions_082324MH.pdf)
which adds a bit more detail. I recommend that you request at least 25G of memory for your interactive session for Visium datasets and more (~40GB) for larger datasets such as Visium HD and Xenium.

### Running RStudio Server on NIAID Skyline
For running RStudio Server, please see Poorani Subramanian's excellent instructions here https://github.com/niaid/hpcR/tree/main/rstudio_server
